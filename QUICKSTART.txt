QUICKSTART for ReDoomEd:

You'll need: ReDoomEd binary (downloaded or built from source), doom-maps.zip (from Romero's
Doom Dump), and doom.wad (iWad from retail Doom)

- Unzip the 'doom-maps.zip' archive
- Run ReDoomEd & select menu item: Project > Open
- On the Open panel: Navigate to the unzipped "doom-maps" directory, then to the subdirectory,
"DoomMaps", and open the file called, "project.dpr"
- An error dialog will appear because ReDoomEd can't find the project's WADfile at the
hard-coded filepath; Click the 'Locate "doom.wad"' button, navigate to the doom.wad file,
& Click 'Open'
- After the project finishes loading, you should see a "Project Inspector" panel with a list of
map names
- Click on 'e1m1' to open the first level map
- It will open at 100% zoom; You can change the zoom using the zoom popup button in the lower
right of the map window, or use the zoom tool

TOOLS:
Select:
  - Click on a line, thing (colored box), or point to select it (turns it red)
  - Click on an empty area & drag to make a selection rectangle (selects everything it
  intersects)
  - Hold down the shift key when clicking to add to an existing selection
  - Click on a selected item & drag to move the entire set of selected items

Poly line:
  - Click & release the mouse to set a starting point for a set of connected lines
  - Move the mouse to another point (line will follow), then click to set an
  endpoint/new-line-startpoint
  - To exit poly line mode, click on an endpoint twice (make a zero-length line)

Line:
  - Click & drag to make a single line

Zoom:
  - Click on the map to zoom in
  - Right-click on the map to zoom out

Move:
  - Click & drag to pan the map view

Sector get/fill:
  - Click on a map sector to load its settings into the Sector Editor panel
  - Right-click on a map sector to change its settings to those currently displayed in the
  Sector Editor panel (changing the settings in the panel will not automatically update the
  selected sector)

New Thing:
  - Click on the map to add a thing matching the current settings in the Thing panel (selecting
  a thing with the Select tool will update the Thing panel settings)

Launch & Save:
  - Clicking on the map will generate a wad file (containing only the current map) with the
  player start location (thing) at the point you clicked - the map wad will be saved in the
  same directory as the project.dpr file

---

 You can also save the current map to a wad file using the menu item:
 'Map > Save DoomEd map/BSP map' (the menu item, 'Map > Save DoomEd map' will only save the
 map's text file - it won't generate a wad).
