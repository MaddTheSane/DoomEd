DoomEd
======

This is the original level editor created by Id Software to create the
levels for *Doom*. In developing *Doom*, Id used NeXTStep workstations,
which at the time were considered very advanced. There is some
information about the development process, including screenshots,
[on Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21405).

The goal of this project is to port the DoomEd source code to Mac OS X,
which is derived from NeXTStep and still has similar Objective C-based
APIs. There is a secondary goal to get it running on other operating
systems using other implementations of the OpenStep API, such as GNUstep
and Cocotron.
